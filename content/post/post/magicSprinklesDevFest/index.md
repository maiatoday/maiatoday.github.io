A shorter version of my Magic Sprinkles talk presented at [DevFest UK Ireland](https://www.devfest-uki.com/schedule) 

Magic Sprinkles: Adding animations to your app with Jetpack Compose

I have some Jetpack Compose UI components in my app and now I want to add animations, where do I start?
In this presentation I will look briefly at the Jetpack Compose animation api to get an overview of the animation system. Then I will look at a few quick win simple animations that can add some magic to your app. I will dive into more complex and custom animations to see what is possible. All of these experiments will be illustrated in a sample app provided in a companion repo.
At the end of this talk you will:

* have an overview of how animation works in Jetpack Compose
* have some practical animation examples that you can add to your app immediately
* have an idea of what is possible with complex and custom animations
* have a code repo of examples
