Devfest 2021 West Sweden lighting talk about Copy Paste Jetpack Compose. CopyPaste is often the first attempt at re-using code, but it has its pitfalls. Some musing on why it seemed easier to copy and paste snippets of code in a Jetpack Compose project. It seems to relate to the composable architecture. Composables can be transplanted easily and modifiers can be grafted from one Composeable to another.

Some pitfalls and things to watch out for and some good places to find code snippets.
