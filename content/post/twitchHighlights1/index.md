To practise for live speaking and to explore how to add Jetpack Compose to an existing open source app, I start a twitch stream as [kibethcodes](https://twitch.com/kibethcodes). The app I chose to work on is [Habitica](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica), a habit tracking/ToDo app that saw it's first commit in 2015.
