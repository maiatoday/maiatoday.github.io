A broad strokes intro to Jetpack Compose followed by a live code demo taster of what it is like to use this framework. The demo ranges from basic use, a bit of Material components and one small animation. Hosted by [DevUG](https://www.meetup.com/DeveloperUG/). In the second part of the event, [Thomas](https://twitter.com/tkuenneth) gives us a summary of what's new in Jetpack Compose 1.1
