Droidcon Berlin 22 what a blast!

I presented a talk  on Compose. I spoke on a panel and made fantastic new friends and caught up with old/online ones.

The panel discussion was about `Android at Scale`

The talk title was `Something old, something new: adding Jetpack Compose to a large open source app`.
