I shared my talk titled Imperative, Declarative, Object oriented, functional: Four of a Kotlin Kind at the [I code Java conference](https://j-sa.co/schedule-java/). 

The abstract:
Is Kotlin a functional language? Yes, but... Is it object oriented? Yes, but...
Looking at four concepts: imperative, declarative, functional and object oriented
How does Kotlin make it easy to use either or all at the same time. This talk contains: Some useful Kotlin tips, some guidelines and pitfalls for the four concepts, traces of definitions and software history. After listening to this talk you will understand what these concepts are, what each is good for and how they are supported by the Kotlin language.
