In 2012 I made my Masters [exhibition][exhibition] using openframeworks and the Kinect. It consisted of 4 interactive works which explored concepts around human ideas and machine execution. The repo [veloPeople][veloPeople] contains all four works each in their own branch. Each work was built on a [custom ubuntu live disk][livedisk]. So the installation works existed on flash disk. Given the right hardware you could boot from the flash disk and run one of the works.
