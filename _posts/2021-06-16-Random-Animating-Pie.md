I am exploring animations with small sampler functions using Jetpack Compose. This one is a custom component that draws a [little pie chart](https://github.com/maiatoday/ComposeSampler/blob/main/app/src/main/java/net/maiatoday/composesampler/ui/components/PieStatus.kt). It will animate a random pie value on the click of the [button](https://github.com/maiatoday/ComposeSampler/blob/main/app/src/main/java/net/maiatoday/composesampler/ui/components/RandomPieButton.kt).
