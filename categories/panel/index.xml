A speedrun of the animation system in Jetpack Compose as a comparison agains SwiftUI and Flutter. Hosted by &lt;a class="link" href="https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-nuremberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>GDG Nuremberg&lt;/a> We discovered many similarites, all the systems have some way to control the animation graph, with somewhat confusing differences in naming. A tween in compose is not the same as a tween in Flutter. Flutter &lt;code>Tween&lt;/code> is an &lt;code>animationSpec&lt;/code> in Compose. Compose &lt;code>tween&lt;/code> is a specific kind of &lt;code>Curve&lt;/code> in Flutter that does a linear interpolation. Oh and its a function in Compose and an object in Flutter.&lt;/p>
