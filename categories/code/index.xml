This one is a custom component that draws a little pie chart. It will animate a random pie value on the click of the button.

This is a toy app that simulates an 8 Ball. It can answer questions, find synonmyms, generate a password or check if a number is prime. It was created to make a situation where it makes sense to use coroutines to e.g. go on the network or make a calculation. Then I added tests for all the pieces using kotlinx-coroutine-test.
As a bonus the repo is set up to run the tests on CircleCi.</description></item><item><title>HelloTrain</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellotrain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellotrain/</guid><description>Exploring railroad error handling in Kotlin.

Enough times for me to extract the gradle bits in to a little nugget of grooviness to just drop into a project as needed. For a while now I have been reading about test coverage numbers and working with my intuition about what is the most valuable thing for me to spend my time on when building something.</description></item><item><title>Note to Future Me — Testing Intents with Matchers</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/note-to-future-me-testing-intents-with-matchers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 14:54:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/note-to-future-me-testing-intents-with-matchers/</guid><description>I want to make my little experiments public and save them as a reminder for future me. So here is yet another post on Matchers and Espresso testing.
I want to test this:
First activity starts another activity at a button click.
First activity passes a parcelable object to the second activity.
Test that the intent that starts the second activity contains the object with the correct properties.</description></item><item><title>HelloKeystore</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellokeystore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2017 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellokeystore/</guid><description>Curious Keystore experiments. A small simple project that saves something in the keystore and gets it out again. Tricksiness happens across versions of Android.
