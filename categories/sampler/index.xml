Everything was pulsing, rotating and animating. I am exploring Jetpack Compose animations and I figured if I can reproduce a 90s web page look, I can do anything. Also June is the month of Rainbows. So to kick off this series I am building animating rainbow text.
First I need a rainbow. It needs to be flexible enough for me to be able to swap in any rainbow.</description></item><item><title>Neotaur-Geotaur</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/neotaur-geotaur/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 14:04:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/neotaur-geotaur/</guid><description>I like to make sampler apps to explore new things to learn. I was wondering how the google location apis differed from the new awereness apis. The Geotaur repo has an app that can use either of these two interfaces. Since it builds two flavours you can run the apps side by side with the same geofences to see how they differ. While I was at it I tried my hand at some other tech too, firebase remote logging and db access, dependency injection.</description></item></channel></rss>
