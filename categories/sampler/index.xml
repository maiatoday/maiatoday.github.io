I was wondering how the google location apis differed from the new awereness apis. The Geotaur repo has an app that can use either of these two interfaces. Since it builds two flavours you can run the apps side by side with the same geofences to see how they differ. While I was at it I tried my hand at some other tech too, firebase remote logging and db access, dependency injection.</description></item></channel></rss>
