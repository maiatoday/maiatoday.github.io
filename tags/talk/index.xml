A speedrun of the animation system in Jetpack Compose as a comparison agains SwiftUI and Flutter. Hosted by GDG Nuremberg We discovered many similarites, all the systems have some way to control the animation graph, with somewhat confusing differences in naming. A tween in compose is not the same as a tween in Flutter. Flutter Tween is an animationSpec in Compose. Compose tween is a specific kind of Curve in Flutter that does a linear interpolation.</description></item><item><title>Magic Sprinkles at DevFest UK Ireland</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/magic-sprinkles-at-devfest-uk-ireland/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 12:53:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/magic-sprinkles-at-devfest-uk-ireland/</guid><description>A shorter version of my Magic Sprinkles talk presented at DevFest UK Ireland

CopyPaste is often the first attempt at re-using code, but it has its pitfalls. Some musing on why it seemed easier to copy and paste snippets of code in a Jetpack Compose project. It seems to relate to the composable architecture. Composables can be transplanted easily and modifiers can be grafted from one Composeable to another.
Some pitfalls and things to watch out for and some good places to find code snippets.</description></item><item><title>Rust vs Kotlin panel discussion</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/rust-vs-kotlin-panel-discussion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:21:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/rust-vs-kotlin-panel-discussion/</guid><description>Panel discussion on Rust and Kotlin for GDG Cape Town</description></item><item><title>Two Talks - Magic Sprinkles: adding animations to a Jetpack Compose app</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/two-talks-magic-sprinkles-adding-animations-to-a-jetpack-compose-app/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:10:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/two-talks-magic-sprinkles-adding-animations-to-a-jetpack-compose-app/</guid><description>I presented a talk for Chicago Roboto 2021 and for GDG Cape Town titled Magic Sprinkles: Adding animations to and existing app. Below are the videos of both talks and the slides
