This is a toy app that simulates an 8 Ball. It can answer questions, find synonmyms, generate a password or check if a number is prime. It was created to make a situation where it makes sense to use coroutines to e.g. go on the network or make a calculation. Then I added tests for all the pieces using kotlinx-coroutine-test.
As a bonus the repo is set up to run the tests on CircleCi.</description></item></channel></rss>
