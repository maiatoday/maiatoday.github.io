[{"content":"Do you remember web pages in the nineties? Everything was pulsing, rotating and animating. I am exploring Jetpack Compose animations and I figured if I can reproduce a 90s web page look, I can do anything. Also June is the month of Rainbows. So to kick off this series I am building animating rainbow text.\nFirst I need a rainbow. It needs to be flexible enough for me to be able to swap in any rainbow.\nval RainbowRed = Color(0xFFDA034E) val RainbowOrange = Color(0xFFFF9800) val RainbowYellow = Color(0xFFFFEB3B) val RainbowGreen = Color(0xFF4CAF50) val RainbowBlue = Color(0xFF2196F3) val RainbowIndigo = Color(0xFF3F51B5) val RainbowViolet = Color(0xFF9C27B0) val SkittlesRainbow = listOf( RainbowRed, RainbowOrange, RainbowYellow, RainbowGreen, RainbowBlue, RainbowIndigo, RainbowViolet ) Since web pages in the nineties used Times New Roman and Helvetica, I added a free version of a serif font. I chose Source Serif. I included the ttf files in the project and made a FontFamily and hooked this into the theme.\n ttf files in projext \nval SourceSerif = FontFamily( Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_regular), Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_bold, FontWeight.Bold), Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_light, FontWeight.Light), Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_black, FontWeight.Black), Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_extra_light, FontWeight.ExtraLight), ) val Typography = Typography(defaultFontFamily = SourceSerif) MaterialTheme( colors = colors, typography = Typography, shapes = Shapes, content = content ) Next I made a composable that would colour each letter of a string. This simple composable took as many text parameters in and then split the string colouring each character to the colour of the rainbow in the parameter. The startColor index is used to pick which colour the first letter will be.\n@Composable fun MultiColorText( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, text: String, style: TextStyle = LocalTextStyle.current, rainbow: List\u0026lt;Color\u0026gt; = SkittlesRainbow, startColor: Int = 0, ) { Row(modifier) { var index = startColor for (letter in text) { Text(letter.toString(), color = rainbow.get(index), style = style) index++ if (index == rainbow.size) index = 0 } } } This allowed me to create a second composable which used an infinite transition to animate continouously. I animate the startColor integer and this will recompose the nested MultiColorText composable. The animateValue will change the value of colorIndex over time and will use the Int.VectorConverter to get a value between 0 and the size of the rainbow. In this way it creates an endless loop of changing integer values. The animation spec is a simple tween() which just changes between the initalvalue and the targetValue in alinear way. Different effects can be created by fiddling with the repeatMode or the other parameters in the animationSpec or adjusting the duration in the tween().\n@Composable fun SnappyRainbowText( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, text: String, style: TextStyle = LocalTextStyle.current, rainbow: List\u0026lt;Color\u0026gt; = SkittlesRainbow ) { require(rainbow.size \u0026gt; 0) val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val colorIndex by infiniteTransition.animateValue( initialValue = 0, targetValue = rainbow.size - 1, typeConverter = Int.VectorConverter, animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable( animation = tween(), repeatMode = RepeatMode.Restart ) ) MultiColorText( text = text, style = style, modifier = modifier, startColor = colorIndex, rainbow = rainbow ) } I made a simple test screen with an edit text field so I could try it out.\n snappy rainbow click me to see the animation \nAs you can see the animation is uhm \u0026hellip; snappy. If you can\u0026rsquo;t see it, click on the image.\nIs it possible to change from one colour to the next smoothly and still have all the letters different colours?\nThe first step is to create a composable that will cycle through a rainbow of colours. This is done by creating a keyframes animation. The keyframe points are the colours of the rainbow.\n@Composable fun MultiColorSmoothText( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, text: String, style: TextStyle = LocalTextStyle.current, rainbow: List\u0026lt;Color\u0026gt; = PastelRainbow, startIndex: Int = 0, duration: Int ) { val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val interval = duration / rainbow.size val color by infiniteTransition.animateColor( initialValue = rainbow[0], targetValue = rainbow.last(), animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable( animation = keyframes { durationMillis = duration delayMillis = startIndex * interval / 2 var i = 0 // set the keyframes from the rainbow with code  for (color in rainbow) { // this is the crux of setting the keyframes  color at i // at is an infix method in the KeyframesSpec class  i += interval } }, repeatMode = RepeatMode.Restart ) ) Text(text = text, color = color, style = style, modifier = modifier) } This composable can be used to loop through colours of the rainbow on a Text composable.\n smooth coloured text \nFinally I built a composable that split the string again and made each letter a MultiColorSmoothText. It uses the startIndex to delay the animation. The effect is that each letter is a different colour.\n@Composable fun SmoothRainbowText( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, text: String, style: TextStyle = LocalTextStyle.current, rainbow: List\u0026lt;Color\u0026gt; = PastelRainbow, startColor: Int = 0, duration: Int = 1200 ) { Row(modifier) { var index = startColor for (letter in text) { MultiColorSmoothText( text = letter.toString(), style = style, rainbow = rainbow, startIndex = index, duration = duration ) index++ if (index == rainbow.size) index = 0 } } } And the final smooth animating rainbow text using a pastel rainbow.\n smooth rainbow test \nNext I\u0026rsquo;ll tackle some more retro 90s web page inspired animations, visitor counters, flames, rotating images, shifting tiled backgrounds and walls of text that change size.\nUntil then\u0026hellip; this ain\u0026rsquo;t not disco\nFind all the source in this repo\n","date":"2021-06-27T00:13:10+02:00","image":"https://maiatoday.github.io/p/animating-rainbow-text/noDisco_hua68bcb7d3448fc4e606dd0d887f39cde_62022_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://maiatoday.github.io/p/animating-rainbow-text/","title":"Animating Rainbow Text"},{"content":"I am exploring animations with small sampler functions using Jetpack Compose.

So here is yet another post on Matchers and Espresso testing.\nI want to test this:\n  First activity starts another activity at a button click.\n  First activity passes a parcelable object to the second activity.\n  Test that the intent that starts the second activity contains the object with the correct properties.\n  I built a contrived example, MainActivity collects some info and passes this to StarActivity in a parcelable called ContrivedParams. See the sample code on GitHub.\n   \nTo write the tests I brushed up on Hamcrest[1][2][3]: a library that makes it easier to write readable tests. Instead of\nassert(expected==actual) you can write almost-english\nassertThat(actual, is(expected)) which is a sugar coated version of\nassertThat(actual is(equalto(expected))) Sadly though is is a hard keyword in Kotlin so I ended up using the isA() and equalTo() varieties of calls rather than escaping is with backticks.\nAnother reason to use Hamcrest — better error messages. Compare these two messages.\njava.lang.AssertionError at net.maiatoday.hellointentmatcher.ContrivedParamsTest.showErroMessagesTest(ContrivedParamsTest.kt:37) with the message given by a custom matcher\njava.lang.AssertionError: Expected: title should return “Hello World” but: was “Hello World!” at net.maiatoday.hellointentmatcher.ContrivedParamsTest.showErroMessagesTest(ContrivedParamsTest.kt:42) or the error message given by an object matcher\njava.lang.AssertionError: Expected: \u0026lt;ContrivedParams(title=Hello World, starCount=3, colour=#00b0ff)\u0026gt; but: was \u0026lt;ContrivedParams(title=Hello World!, starCount=4, colour=#00b0fff)\u0026gt; at net.maiatoday.hellointentmatcher.ContrivedParamsTest.showErroMessagesTest(ContrivedParamsTest.kt:47) The parameters for the second activity is passed in a parcelable data class.\nI used the Espresso-intents library . Start the activity with an IntentsTestRule. The IntentsTestRule initialises the Espresso intents before each test and releases them again after the test completes. I used the intended method to test the intent and the hasEntry method to check for the extra. I compared the extra with an expected object. As a bonus I wrote a custom matcher to check the properties of the object that was in the intent. Custom matchers are useful if you do not need to check all of the properties in the data object.\nThe intent test:\nOne of the custom matchers:\n All green  All green\n","date":"2018-01-26T14:54:45.273Z","image":"https://maiatoday.github.io/p/note-to-future-me-testing-intents-with-matchers/testResults_hu1ffbce21a844d54d5e824864182148d0_47423_120x120_fill_box_smart1_2.png","permalink":"https://maiatoday.github.io/p/note-to-future-me-testing-intents-with-matchers/","title":"Note to Future Me — Testing Intents with Matchers"},{"content":"Curious Keystore experiments.
