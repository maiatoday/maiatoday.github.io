I first showed the modifier in my presentation for Chicago Roboto but since I made it something was bothering me. The way that I can get the state in Compose to register change is by making copies of objects or making new objects. For a modifier that uses particles this can be many objects.\nI profiled my original modifier and sure enough I see the object allocation and also the garbage collectore cleaning up when the confetti modifier is visible.\nFast forward to Dec 2021 and my friends over at Code with Italians built a similar snow modifier. Revisiting my modifier, I cleaned it up. I managed to get rid of some of the object allocation. However since it is a particle system and each of the particles change position, it needs some form of state that changes as the position of the particles change. I used the Offset class as this is the object that a Circle needs to draw and the object has been optimised to pack the x and y floats. It also has some other useful functions and operators. Offset is immutable so if the particle changes position a new object is made. It is smaller than my original implementation. It isn\u0026rsquo;t really fair to compare the screenshot below with the one above as the time over which the heap capture ran is is not the same. The shallow size of Offset is 16 and the shallow size of the original Confetto objects is 24 and the point inside the Confetto object also has a shallow size of 16. The improvements eliminated the allocation of the extra Confetto object.\nMy intuition says it is preferable to sprinkle the memory with fewer smaller pieces of confetti rather than many larger ones. Still there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a way around it since Offset is immutable and Compose is built around tracking unidirectional state flow. Mutable State holder classes won\u0026rsquo;t register a change if the object that holds the state doesn\u0026rsquo;t change. This means if I keep an object that holds the position of the particle and I simply change the x and y values in he mutable state holder will not register a change. Here is a detail discussion on mutable state.\nHow to build your own drawing modifier You need a extension function on modifier like so-\nfun Modifier.confetti( // all your parameters to set up the modifier ) = composed { // the composed function gives you a composition on each composable where this modifier is used  // remeber any state you need here  var confettiState by remember { mutableStateOf( ConfettiState( // parameters to setup the state  ) ) } LaunchedEffect(isVisible) { while (isVisible \u0026amp;\u0026amp; isActive) { withFrameMillis { newTick -\u0026gt; // this side effect will return a tick every frame giving  // the elapsed time since the previous frame  // This would be the place where you move the particles  } } } onSizeChanged { // do what you need to do if the size changes  }.drawBehind { // this is where you can draw behind what ever composable content.  // It proveds a drawScope with a canvas which you can use  // e.g. loop through the particles and draw them  } } Then it is as simple as adding the modifier to any composable, e.g. here is a black box with red Hello World and confetti behind.\nBox(modifier = Modifier .background(Color.Black) .fillMaxSize() .confetti() ) { Text(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;, color = Color.Red) } The code for the cleaned up confetti modifier\n","date":"2021-12-31T07:37:42+02:00","image":"https://www.maiatoday.net/p/confetti-cleanup/confetti_doge_hua96701f229dcdbb6d8818d2e1e5ed2c2_156508_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://www.maiatoday.net/p/confetti-cleanup/","title":"Confetti Cleanup"},{"content":"Introduction to Jetpack Compose technical talk to embeded, mobile and flutter developers.

I wanted to change the counter component to animate each number individually to get that odometer look.\nBefore doing this though there was a question of state. I wanted to make a counter that would auto increment in a coroutine. It had to change direction up or down if you tapped it. To do this I decided to store the state and the counting direction in a view model. This allowed me to keep the components as stateless as possible. The components are re-usable because the logic that makes the numbers go up or down is held outside of the composable functions.\nThe recommendation from Google is when you use a view model to hold state, keep it close to the root screen. I made a screen for my visitor counter and added it to my navigation code. Since I already had Hilt enabled in the project it was pretty easy to get hold of the viewmodel. The code snippet in the Navigation looks like this:\nNavHost(navController, startDestination = \u0026#34;overview\u0026#34;) { //... other routes go here  composable(route = \u0026#34;counter\u0026#34;) { val viewModel: CounterViewModel = hiltViewModel() //\u0026lt;--- get the viewmodel from Hilt  val count by viewModel.counter.collectAsState() //\u0026lt;--- the viewmodel exposes the counter as a StateFlow  CounterScreen( count = count, onClick = { viewModel.onClick() } // \u0026lt;--- the viewmodel provides a method for when the element is clicked  ) } } The CounterScreen is stateless and gets the value of the counter and the event handler as parameters. The CounterScreen has a Counter composable. The role of the Counter composable is to create a row of individual odometer numbers from the passed values. Also it should intercept a click and call the click handler.\n@Composable fun Counter( onClick: () -\u0026gt; Unit, count: Int, width: Int ) { val displayWidth = maxOf(3, width) Row( modifier = Modifier.clickable( interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }, indication = null, onClick = onClick ), ) { for (n in displayWidth - 1 downTo 0) { //\u0026lt;--- this loop builds the row based on the number  CounterCell( count = (count.toDouble() / 10.0.pow(n) % 10).toInt(), //\u0026lt;--- split the number in to units, tens, hundreds etc  width = 1 //\u0026lt;--- set each cell to only be one digit wide  ) } } } The actual animation happens in each CounterCell. It uses AnimatedContent to slide from the top if the new number is more than the previous one and slide from the bottom if the new number is lower than the first.\n@Composable fun CounterCell( count: Int, width: Int ) { val numbersSlidingAnimation: AnimatedContentScope\u0026lt;Int\u0026gt;.() -\u0026gt; ContentTransform = { if (initialState \u0026gt; targetState) { slideInVertically(initialOffsetY = { it }) + fadeIn() with slideOutVertically( targetOffsetY = { -it }) + fadeOut() } else { slideInVertically(initialOffsetY = { -it }) + fadeIn() with slideOutVertically( targetOffsetY = { it }) + fadeOut() } } AnimatedContent( targetState = count, transitionSpec = numbersSlidingAnimation ) { number -\u0026gt; Text(text = number.toString().padStart(width, \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;)) } } You can see what this looks like in the gifs below.\nAll that is left to complete this example is the view model.\nAs you can see from the code by making the composable functions simple and stateless, it is possible to separate the UI requirements from the logic that drives it. This is a useful pattern because it allows the view model to be tested properly. It makes the composables themselves re-usable for different situations. Who knows, you could animate click counts or visitors or changing crypto wallet values all with the same re-usable component.\nFind all the source in this repo\nAlso in this series:\nRainbowText\nBlinkTag\n","date":"2021-07-12T21:44:03+02:00","image":"https://www.maiatoday.net/p/welcome-you-are-visitor-number-12345/visitorCounter_hu9d445d78dd9da3a596374f2fa2fb4085_20893_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://www.maiatoday.net/p/welcome-you-are-visitor-number-12345/","title":"Welcome you are visitor number 12345"},{"content":"Another small experiment to explore Jetpack Compose animations. I came to the conclusion that any value that is passed as a parameter could be animated, including anything in the modifier. So I set out to build a \u0026lt;blink\u0026gt; tag.\nMy first attempt creates a composable function that takes the modifier, animates it and passes it back to the content lambda. Like this:\n@Composable fun BlinkTag( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, durationMillis: Int = 500, content: @Composable (modifier: Modifier) -\u0026gt; Unit ) { val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val alpha: Float by infiniteTransition.animateFloat( initialValue = 1f, targetValue = 0f, animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable( animation = tween(durationMillis = durationMillis), repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse ) ) content(modifier = modifier.alpha(alpha)) } When you use it you get a modifier back which you then pass to your content.\nBlinkTag Row { Icon( modifier = it, // \u0026lt;- like so  tint = RainbowRed, painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.ic_android_black_24dp), contentDescription = null // decorative element  ) Text( text = \u0026#34;blinky\u0026#34;, color = RainbowRed, modifier = it.padding(8.dp) // \u0026lt;- and here too  ) } } The animation for this was a linear tween() between invisible and visible. However anyone who knows the blink tag will realise that it stays on longer than off. It blips off and then comes back on again staying visible for longer.\nTo do this I replaced the tween() with keyframes:\n@Composable fun BlinkTag( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, duration: Int = 500, content: @Composable (modifier: Modifier) -\u0026gt; Unit ) { val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val alpha: Float by infiniteTransition.animateFloat( initialValue = 1f, targetValue = 0f, animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable( animation = keyframes { durationMillis = duration 1f at (duration*0.8).toInt() // we started at 1 and stay here for 80% of the time  0f at duration // then drop down to 0 in the last 20% of the time  }, repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse ) ) content(modifier = modifier.alpha(alpha)) } Reading the material theme docs I found out there was another way to share alpha values to a children in the composable tree using a LocalContentAlpha. This mechanims is used for emphasis using alpha and I am pretty sure the intention isn\u0026rsquo;t for this to be used to make layouts blink. I am doing this for science.\n@Composable fun LocalContentBlinkTag( durationMillis: Int = 500, content: @Composable () -\u0026gt; Unit ) { val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val alpha: Float by infiniteTransition.animateFloat( initialValue = 1f, targetValue = 0f, animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable( animation = tween(durationMillis = durationMillis), repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse ) ) CompositionLocalProvider(LocalContentAlpha provides alpha) { content() } } When using this blink tag you no longer need to pass down the modifier since the changing alpha value is available to the children in a CompositionLocal\nUse it like this:\nLocalContentBlinkTag { Row { Icon( painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.ic_android_black_24dp), contentDescription = null // decorative element  ) Text(text = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;blink\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) } } Although I defintely don\u0026rsquo;t support the irresponsible use of the blink tag, no investigation of reproducing retro website animations would be complete without a \u0026lt;blink\u0026gt; I realised again how powerful yet simple the animation system in Jetpack Compose can be.

Everything was pulsing, rotating and animating. I am exploring Jetpack Compose animations and I figured if I can reproduce a 90s web page look, I can do anything. Also June is the month of Rainbows. So to kick off this series I am building animating rainbow text.\nFirst I need a rainbow. It needs to be flexible enough for me to be able to swap in any rainbow.\nval RainbowRed = Color(0xFFDA034E) val RainbowOrange = Color(0xFFFF9800) val RainbowYellow = Color(0xFFFFEB3B) val RainbowGreen = Color(0xFF4CAF50) val RainbowBlue = Color(0xFF2196F3) val RainbowIndigo = Color(0xFF3F51B5) val RainbowViolet = Color(0xFF9C27B0) val SkittlesRainbow = listOf( RainbowRed, RainbowOrange, RainbowYellow, RainbowGreen, RainbowBlue, RainbowIndigo, RainbowViolet ) Since web pages in the nineties used Times New Roman and Helvetica, I added a free version of a serif font. I chose Source Serif. I included the ttf files in the project and made a FontFamily and hooked this into the theme.\nval SourceSerif = FontFamily( Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_regular), Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_bold, FontWeight.Bold), Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_light, FontWeight.Light), Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_black, FontWeight.Black), Font(R.font.source_serif_pro_extra_light, FontWeight.ExtraLight), ) val Typography = Typography(defaultFontFamily = SourceSerif) MaterialTheme( colors = colors, typography = Typography, shapes = Shapes, content = content ) Next I made a composable that would colour each letter of a string. This simple composable took as many text parameters in and then split the string colouring each character to the colour of the rainbow in the parameter. The startColor index is used to pick which colour the first letter will be.\n@Composable fun MultiColorText( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, text: String, style: TextStyle = LocalTextStyle.current, rainbow: List\u0026lt;Color\u0026gt; = SkittlesRainbow, startColor: Int = 0, ) { Row(modifier) { var index = startColor for (letter in text) { Text(letter.toString(), color = rainbow.get(index), style = style) index++ if (index == rainbow.size) index = 0 } } } This allowed me to create a second composable which used an infinite transition to animate continouously. I animate the startColor integer and this will recompose the nested MultiColorText composable. The animateValue will change the value of colorIndex over time and will use the Int.VectorConverter to get a value between 0 and the size of the rainbow. In this way it creates an endless loop of changing integer values. The animation spec is a simple tween() which just changes between the initalvalue and the targetValue in alinear way. Different effects can be created by fiddling with the repeatMode or the other parameters in the animationSpec or adjusting the duration in the tween().\n@Composable fun SnappyRainbowText( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, text: String, style: TextStyle = LocalTextStyle.current, rainbow: List\u0026lt;Color\u0026gt; = SkittlesRainbow ) { require(rainbow.size \u0026gt; 0) val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val colorIndex by infiniteTransition.animateValue( initialValue = 0, targetValue = rainbow.size - 1, typeConverter = Int.VectorConverter, animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable( animation = tween(), repeatMode = RepeatMode.Restart ) ) MultiColorText( text = text, style = style, modifier = modifier, startColor = colorIndex, rainbow = rainbow ) } I made a simple test screen with an edit text field so I could try it out.\nAs you can see the animation is uhm \u0026hellip; snappy. If you can\u0026rsquo;t see it, click on the image.\nIs it possible to change from one colour to the next smoothly and still have all the letters different colours?\nThe first step is to create a composable that will cycle through a rainbow of colours. This is done by creating a keyframes animation. The keyframe points are the colours of the rainbow.\n@Composable fun MultiColorSmoothText( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, text: String, style: TextStyle = LocalTextStyle.current, rainbow: List\u0026lt;Color\u0026gt; = PastelRainbow, startIndex: Int = 0, duration: Int ) { val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val interval = duration / rainbow.size val color by infiniteTransition.animateColor( initialValue = rainbow[0], targetValue = rainbow.last(), animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable( animation = keyframes { durationMillis = duration delayMillis = startIndex * interval / 2 var i = 0 // set the keyframes from the rainbow with code  for (color in rainbow) { // this is the crux of setting the keyframes  color at i // at is an infix method in the KeyframesSpec class  i += interval } }, repeatMode = RepeatMode.Restart ) ) Text(text = text, color = color, style = style, modifier = modifier) } This composable can be used to loop through colours of the rainbow on a Text composable.\nFinally I built a composable that split the string again and made each letter a MultiColorSmoothText. It uses the startIndex to delay the animation.

So here is yet another post on Matchers and Espresso testing.\nI want to test this:\n  First activity starts another activity at a button click.\n  First activity passes a parcelable object to the second activity.\n  Test that the intent that starts the second activity contains the object with the correct properties.\n  I built a contrived example, MainActivity collects some info and passes this to StarActivity in a parcelable called ContrivedParams. See the sample code on GitHub.\nTo write the tests I brushed up on Hamcrest[1][2][3]: a library that makes it easier to write readable tests. Instead of\nassert(expected==actual) you can write almost-english\nassertThat(actual, is(expected)) which is a sugar coated version of\nassertThat(actual is(equalto(expected))) Sadly though is is a hard keyword in Kotlin so I ended up using the isA() and equalTo() varieties of calls rather than escaping is with backticks.\nAnother reason to use Hamcrest — better error messages. Compare these two messages.\njava.lang.AssertionError at net.maiatoday.hellointentmatcher.ContrivedParamsTest.showErroMessagesTest(ContrivedParamsTest.kt:37) with the message given by a custom matcher\njava.lang.AssertionError: Expected: title should return “Hello World” but: was “Hello World!” at net.maiatoday.hellointentmatcher.ContrivedParamsTest.showErroMessagesTest(ContrivedParamsTest.kt:42) or the error message given by an object matcher\njava.lang.AssertionError: Expected: \u0026lt;ContrivedParams(title=Hello World, starCount=3, colour=#00b0ff)\u0026gt; but: was \u0026lt;ContrivedParams(title=Hello World!, starCount=4, colour=#00b0fff)\u0026gt; at net.maiatoday.hellointentmatcher.ContrivedParamsTest.showErroMessagesTest(ContrivedParamsTest.kt:47) The parameters for the second activity is passed in a parcelable data class.\nI used the Espresso-intents library . Start the activity with an IntentsTestRule. The IntentsTestRule initialises the Espresso intents before each test and releases them again after the test completes. I used the intended method to test the intent and the hasEntry method to check for the extra. I compared the extra with an expected object. As a bonus I wrote a custom matcher to check the properties of the object that was in the intent. Custom matchers are useful if you do not need to check all of the properties in the data object.\nThe intent test:\nOne of the custom matchers:\nAll green\n","date":"2018-01-26T14:54:45.273Z","image":"https://www.maiatoday.net/p/note-to-future-me-testing-intents-with-matchers/testResults_hu1ffbce21a844d54d5e824864182148d0_47423_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://www.maiatoday.net/p/note-to-future-me-testing-intents-with-matchers/","title":"Note to Future Me — Testing Intents with Matchers"},{"content":"Curious Keystore experiments.
