Magic Sprinkles: Adding animations to your app with Jetpack Compose
I have some Jetpack Compose UI components in my app and now I want to add animations, where do I start? In this presentation I will look briefly at the Jetpack Compose animation api to get an overview of the animation system. Then I will look at a few quick win simple animations that can add some magic to your app.</description></item><item><title>Confetti Cleanup</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/confetti-cleanup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 07:37:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/confetti-cleanup/</guid><description>In my exploration of animation in Jetpack Compose I built a Confetti modifier that could be applied to any composable. I first showed the modifier in my presentation for Chicago Roboto but since I made it something was bothering me. The way that I can get the state in Compose to register change is by making copies of objects or making new objects. For a modifier that uses particles this can be many objects.</description></item><item><title>Intro to Jetpack Compose</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/intro-to-jetpack-compose/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 16:36:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/intro-to-jetpack-compose/</guid><description>Introduction to Jetpack Compose technical talk to embeded, mobile and flutter developers.

hit counters
I was inspired by a recent episode of Code with Italians where they animated a time field. I wanted to change the counter component to animate each number individually to get that odometer look.
Before doing this though there was a question of state.</description></item><item><title>&lt;blink> like it's 1999</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/blink-like-its-1999/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 17:27:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/blink-like-its-1999/</guid><description>Another small experiment to explore Jetpack Compose animations. I came to the conclusion that any value that is passed as a parameter could be animated, including anything in the modifier. So I set out to build a &amp;lt;blink&amp;gt; tag.
My first attempt creates a composable function that takes the modifier, animates it and passes it back to the content lambda. Like this:
@Composable fun BlinkTag( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, durationMillis: Int = 500, content: @Composable (modifier: Modifier) -&amp;gt; Unit ) { val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val alpha: Float by infiniteTransition.</description></item><item><title>Animating Rainbow Text</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/animating-rainbow-text/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 00:13:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/animating-rainbow-text/</guid><description>Do you remember web pages in the nineties? Everything was pulsing, rotating and animating. I am exploring Jetpack Compose animations and I figured if I can reproduce a 90s web page look, I can do anything. Also June is the month of Rainbows. So to kick off this series I am building animating rainbow text.
First I need a rainbow. It needs to be flexible enough for me to be able to swap in any rainbow.</description></item><item><title>Random Animating Pie Button</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/random-animating-pie-button/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 21:36:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/random-animating-pie-button/</guid><description>I am exploring animations with small sampler functions using Jetpack Compose.

This is a toy app that simulates an 8 Ball. It can answer questions, find synonmyms, generate a password or check if a number is prime. It was created to make a situation where it makes sense to use coroutines to e.g. go on the network or make a calculation. Then I added tests for all the pieces using kotlinx-coroutine-test.
As a bonus the repo is set up to run the tests on CircleCi.</description></item><item><title>HelloTrain</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellotrain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellotrain/</guid><description>Exploring railroad error handling in Kotlin.

I was wondering how the google location apis differed from the new awereness apis. The Geotaur repo has an app that can use either of these two interfaces. Since it builds two flavours you can run the apps side by side with the same geofences to see how they differ. While I was at it I tried my hand at some other tech too, firebase remote logging and db access, dependency injection.</description></item><item><title>autoselfie 2013</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/autoselfie-2013/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2014 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/autoselfie-2013/</guid><description>An android app to explore how apps can modify images and detect faces.
