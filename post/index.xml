I first showed the modifier in my presentation for Chicago Roboto but since I made it something was bothering me. The way that I can get the state in Compose to register change is by making copies of objects or making new objects. For a modifier that uses particles this can be many objects.</description></item><item><title>Welcome you are visitor number 12345</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/welcome-you-are-visitor-number-12345/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 21:44:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/welcome-you-are-visitor-number-12345/</guid><description>Another step forward in recreating the icon 90s website look is the hit counter, visitor counter or web counter in classic squemorphic odometer style.
hit counters
I was inspired by a recent episode of Code with Italians where they animated a time field. I wanted to change the counter component to animate each number individually to get that odometer look.
Before doing this though there was a question of state.</description></item><item><title>&lt;blink> like it's 1999</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/blink-like-its-1999/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 17:27:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/blink-like-its-1999/</guid><description>Another small experiment to explore Jetpack Compose animations. I came to the conclusion that any value that is passed as a parameter could be animated, including anything in the modifier. So I set out to build a &amp;lt;blink&amp;gt; tag.
My first attempt creates a composable function that takes the modifier, animates it and passes it back to the content lambda. Like this:
@Composable fun BlinkTag( modifier: Modifier = Modifier, durationMillis: Int = 500, content: @Composable (modifier: Modifier) -&amp;gt; Unit ) { val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition() val alpha: Float by infiniteTransition.</description></item><item><title>Animating Rainbow Text</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/animating-rainbow-text/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 00:13:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/animating-rainbow-text/</guid><description>Do you remember web pages in the nineties? Everything was pulsing, rotating and animating. I am exploring Jetpack Compose animations and I figured if I can reproduce a 90s web page look, I can do anything. Also June is the month of Rainbows. So to kick off this series I am building animating rainbow text.
First I need a rainbow. It needs to be flexible enough for me to be able to swap in any rainbow.</description></item><item><title>Random Animating Pie Button</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/random-animating-pie-button/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 21:36:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/random-animating-pie-button/</guid><description>I am exploring animations with small sampler functions using Jetpack Compose. This one is a custom component that draws a little pie chart. It will animate a random pie value on the click of the button.

This is a toy app that simulates an 8 Ball. It can answer questions, find synonmyms, generate a password or check if a number is prime. It was created to make a situation where it makes sense to use coroutines to e.g. go on the network or make a calculation. Then I added tests for all the pieces using kotlinx-coroutine-test.
As a bonus the repo is set up to run the tests on CircleCi.</description></item><item><title>HelloTrain</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellotrain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellotrain/</guid><description>Exploring railroad error handling in Kotlin.

Enough times for me to extract the gradle bits in to a little nugget of grooviness to just drop into a project as needed. For a while now I have been reading about test coverage numbers and working with my intuition about what is the most valuable thing for me to spend my time on when building something.</description></item><item><title>Note to future me — Adding GraphQL to an app</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/note-to-future-me-adding-graphql-to-an-app/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2018 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/note-to-future-me-adding-graphql-to-an-app/</guid><description>Adding the library to the app see commit 03bd7a7534f7a23276fc47c4f7c94d7ac153bc0b

First activity passes a parcelable object to the second activity.
Test that the intent that starts the second activity contains the object with the correct properties.</description></item><item><title>HelloKeystore</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellokeystore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2017 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/hellokeystore/</guid><description>Curious Keystore experiments.

I was wondering how the google location apis differed from the new awereness apis. The Geotaur repo has an app that can use either of these two interfaces. Since it builds two flavours you can run the apps side by side with the same geofences to see how they differ. While I was at it I tried my hand at some other tech too, firebase remote logging and db access, dependency injection.</description></item><item><title>autoselfie 2013</title><link>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/autoselfie-2013/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2014 21:36:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maiatoday.github.io/p/autoselfie-2013/</guid><description>An android app to explore how apps can modify images and detect faces.

It consisted of 4 interactive works which explored concepts around human ideas and machine execution. The repo veloPeople contains all four works each in their own branch. Each work was built on a custom ubuntu live disk. So the installation works existed on flash disk. Given the right hardware you could boot from the flash disk and run one of the works.</description></item></channel></rss>
